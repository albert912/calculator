1. When I click "backspace" button it deletes even there is only one number in the display and shows blank screen.

Possible solutions :

a.1.

(disp.textContent !== "0"|| disp.textContent !== "1" || disp.textContent !== "2" || disp.textContent !== "3" || disp.textContent !== "4" || disp.textContent !== "5" || disp.textContent !== "6" || disp.textContent !== "7" || disp.textContent !== "8" || disp.textContent !== "9")

This doesn't work.

a.2. document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {

   if (event.key === "Backspace") {

   
      let text = disp.textContent;
   
      let backspace = text.slice(0, -1);
      
      /// find a solution later on how to set first digit numbers to 0 if this is clicked
      
      if (disp.textContent !== "0" && disp.textContent !== "1" && disp.textContent !== "2" && disp.textContent !== "3" && disp.textContent !== "4" && disp.textContent !== "5" && disp.textContent !== "6" && disp.textContent !== "7" && disp.textContent !== "8" && disp.textContent !== "9") {

      disp.textContent = backspace;

     }

     else {

      disp.textContent = 0;
     }
      
    
   }
   
   
   });




This often works but there are issues with it.

I realized that this code also has the same issue with the text.lenght issue i.d. when I refresh the page and start to enter a number and click "Backspace" the display turns blank but when I click "clear" and then enter an one digit number the page doesn't turn blank.

I've found out that the extra white space pops up after I enter a number when I refresh the page.

b.Use text.lenght.


document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {

   if (event.key === "Backspace") {

   
      let text = disp.textContent;
   
      let backspace = text.slice(0, -1);
      
      /// find a solution later on how to set first digit numbers to 0 if this is clicked
      
      if (disp.textContent.length <= 1) {
         
         disp.textContent = 0;
     
     }

    if (disp.textContent.length >= 2)  {
   
      disp.textContent = backspace;

     }
      
    
   }
   
   
   });






(Issues with  text.length --> when I refresh the page, after I enter a number on display, and additional white space pops up -this can be seen on elements section of the developer console-- and this neutralizes my code.

I realized that when I press clear after refreshing the page, no additional white space pop ups and my code works.)

 ---> I fixed this issue by removing the gap between quotes (" ") in result variables in event.key === number variables.

Focus on this issues:

Click event

After the first operator, firstNum and operator is saved but secondNumber is not saved. After the second operator, firstNum is saved, but operator and secondNum is not saved. ( This is not an issue actually!)

(There are some small issues, but I will try to fix them later.)

Keydown event

a.After the first operator only first num is saved, after the second operator only the result(firstNum) saved.

a. is fixed. The issue happened because there was a gap between quotes (" ") in (secondNum!== " ") statement.


b.When I click /, *, - operators, I get division error.



b. is fixed. The issue happened for two reason. first one is the same as above (I forgot to do the same thing in other operator codes) and there was disp.textContent === "0" condition in the if statement which was related to the division operator in the calculate function.




----
2. When I try to divide a small number (such as 0.125) with a number, there are two decimals in the result.

2.fixed = I realized that I forgot covering the code under the if statement with else condition.


3. When I click - operator for the first time I get "0" on the display. If I click it second time after entering second number, the second number has - left to it.

3.fixed = I realized that there is a space between quotes in if (firstNUm !== "") statement in if event.key === "-" condition.



4. Entered numbers overflows from the screen.


(Optional minor ones)

a. In the ideal calculator , pops up after 3 number is entered to display.

----

Styling Issues.

1. width of the display wrap padding is shorter than the width of the button wrap padding.

2. buttons do not cover the rest of the calculator div and appear as a grid. (*) (fixed)

3. there is no vertical gap between buttons. (fixed)

4. the "C" and "=" button do not fill the rest of their lines. (fixed)
