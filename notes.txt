operator action progress

(My thinking) 1. I need to enter the first number:

2. I need to click on operator.

3. I need to enter second number.

4. I need to click equal sign so that the result would be shown on the calculator display. 

----

Soo it looks like when I enter the second number after I click the operator, the result should be stored in variable, and when I click equal sign, this variable name should be used to shown the result on the calculator display.


-------

Problems related to first method.

I realized that when created for functions under event delegation I didn't know how to store the second number and I was stucked.

I may clear the first number when I click the operators, but I am not sure how to proceed after this. From what I realized I need to calculate and display the result by clicking equal sign (=) not via clicking the operators.

-------

SECOND METHOD

when you use a calculator, after inputing the firstOperand and you click the operator and that clears  the screen so you can input the secondOperand.

save the firtOperand when Operator was clicked, the next inputed nums save on the secondOperand.

-----

Actions that must happen when I click the operator

1. First Number should be deleted.

2. First Number should be saved ( I assume that it should be stored in a variable).

---

The next inputed nums (second number) should be saved in a variable.

-----------

Steps according to my last algorithm logic.

a. first number should be entered and it should be displayed. 

b. a specific operator should be clicked.

b.1. first number should be deleted when I click on operators.

b.2. first number should be saved in a variable.

b.3. the calculator should remember the specific operator that was chosen.

c. second number should be entered it should be displayed.

d. second number should be stored.

e. two thing should happen after clicking equal sign

 e.1. the result should be calculated by using the specific operator on b (b.3)

 e.2. the result should be shown on the calculator display.
